Apache Camel
Sql Component - allows you to work with databases using JDBC queries. Uses Spring-JDBC in background for sql handling

-Difference between sql and JDBC component - is that in case of SQL the query is a property of the endpoint. 
Used endpoint URI notation 
eg. 	sql:select * from table where id=# order by name[?options]

- It uses message payload as named parameters passed to the query.
eg.use named parameters by using :#name_of_the_parameter style as shown:

	sql:select * from table where id=:#myId order by name[?options]

- When using named parameters, Camel will lookup the names from, in the given precedence:

 1.from a Simple expressions

 2.from message body if its a java.util.Map

 3.from message headers

- '#' symbol denotes the parameters to an SQL query is substituted with
