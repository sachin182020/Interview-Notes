2 ways to create Thread :
- implement Runnable interface - override public void run() method and write task performed by that thread in it
- extend Thread class - create public void run() method and write task performed by that thread in it

States of Thread 
New - Before the execution of start() thread method
Runnable - 
Running
Blocked/Waiting
Terminated

Set Priority request for Threads - just a request for priority which may or may not be honoured. doesn't actully ensure order
syntax: threadName.setPriority(priority);
/**
     * The minimum priority that a thread can have.
     */
    public static final int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;

    /**
     * The default priority that is assigned to a thread.
     */
    public static final int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;

    /**
     * The maximum priority that a thread can have.
     */
    public static final int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;

*Static methods of Thread class*

Communication between threads - join method - join method is used to wait for that thread to complete
syntax : threadName.join();

sleep(milisecs) method of Thread class to put thread into sleep/wait state
syntax : eg. threadName.sleep(1000);

yeild() - request to scheduler that current thread is willing to giveup/yeild current use of processor. scheduler can ignore this request
syntax: eg. threadName.yeild();

**Synchronized keyword - If you put synchronized keyword on instance/method only thread can access it at a time other thread will have to 
			 wait for access until first thread execution completes


**ExecutorService***
An ExecutorService is a Java interface that provides a way to execute tasks asynchronously. 
It is a more flexible and powerful alternative to the Thread class
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executorService.execute(new Task1())
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); - provides facility to run one thread at a time
executorService.execute(new Task1()); 		  -- execute() method to execute Task1 thread (Task1 Thread class)
executorService.execute(new Thread(new Task2())); -- Task2() runnable interface passed to Thread class then execute()
executorService.shutdown(); - If executorService is not shutdown programs keeps on running

**Customized ExecutorService**
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n); -- At any point n threads will be active
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); -- In this case 2 threads will run

**Return value from threads**
